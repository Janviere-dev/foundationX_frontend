      'Parts of speech are categories of words based on how they are used in a sentence.',
  detailedContent: '''
Every word in the English language belongs to a particular group called a part of speech. These groups help us understand the role each word plays in communication.

The eight main parts of speech are:

• Noun – Names a person, place, thing or idea.
Examples: teacher, Kigali, happiness

• Pronoun – Replaces a noun.
Examples: he, she, they, it

• Verb – Shows an action or state of being.
Examples: run, write, is

• Adjective – Describes a noun.
Examples: beautiful, tall, blue

• Adverb – Describes a verb, adjective or another adverb.
Examples: quickly, carefully, very

• Preposition – Shows the relationship between words.
Examples: on, under, beside

• Conjunction – Joins words or sentences.
Examples: and, but, because

• Interjection – Expresses emotion.
Examples: Wow!, Ouch!, Hurray!

Understanding parts of speech helps learners write grammatically correct and meaningful sentences.

To identify parts of speech, ask simple questions about each word.

Who or what?
→ Usually a noun.

What is happening?
→ Usually the verb.

Which one?
→ Usually an adjective.

How?
→ Usually an adverb.

Example:

"The clever student answered quickly."

clever = Adjective
student = Noun
answered = Verb
quickly = Adverb

A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. Every sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with the correct punctuation mark.

There are four main types of sentences:

• Declarative Sentence
Makes a statement.
Example:
The students are studying.

• Interrogative Sentence
Asks a question.
Example:
Where do you live?

• Imperative Sentence
Gives a command or instruction.
Example:
Please close the door.

• Exclamatory Sentence
Expresses strong emotion.

What a beautiful day!

Tense tells us when an action happens. The present tense is used for actions happening now, habits, routines, and general truths.

There are four forms of the present tense:

• Simple Present

Example:

• Present Continuous
Used for actions happening now.
Example:

• Present Perfect
Used for actions completed recently or with present importance.

A pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun. Instead of repeating the same noun many times, pronouns make our speech and writing smoother.

Example:

She likes it.

Common types of pronouns include:

Examples: mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs

• Demonstrative Pronouns

      'A summary is a short version of a longer passage that contains only the main ideas.',
  detailedContent: '''
Summary writing is the process of reducing a long piece of writing into a shorter version while keeping its main ideas.

A good summary:

• Includes only the important points.
• Leaves out unnecessary details and examples.
• Uses your own words whenever possible.
• Is much shorter than the original passage.
• Maintains the original meaning.

Example:

Original:
Every Saturday, John wakes up early, cleans his room, washes his clothes, helps his parents in the garden, and later plays football with his friends.

Summary:
John spends Saturdays helping at home before playing football.

Notice that the summary keeps only the important information.

Summary writing helps students study faster and understand information better.

Voice refers to the relationship between the subject and the action in a sentence.

There are two types of voice:

1. Active Voice

In active voice, the subject performs the action.

Structure:
Subject + Verb + Object

Examples:

• Mary baked a cake.
• The students completed the assignment.
• The dog chased the cat.

Active voice is usually clearer and more direct.

2. Passive Voice

In passive voice, the subject receives the action.

Structure:
Object + form of "be" + past participle + by + subject

Examples:

• A cake was baked by Mary.
• The assignment was completed by the students.
• The cat was chased by the dog.

Sometimes the person performing the action is unknown or unimportant.

Example:

The classroom was cleaned.

Here, we do not know who cleaned it.

Both voices are correct, but active voice is generally preferred because it is easier to understand.

  explanation:
      'Idioms are expressions whose meanings cannot be understood from the individual words.',
  detailedContent: '''
An idiom is a group of words with a special meaning that is different from the literal meaning of the words.

For example:
• "Break the ice" means to begin a conversation and make people feel comfortable.
• "Hit the nail on the head" means to say exactly the right thing.
• "Once in a blue moon" means something that happens very rarely.
• "Piece of cake" means something very easy.
• "Under the weather" means feeling ill.

Idioms make speech and writing more interesting. They are commonly used in conversations, books, newspapers, and speeches.

When learning idioms, focus on understanding their meanings rather than translating each word literally.

Reading widely and practising conversations will help you become familiar with common idioms.

      'Proverbs are short, wise sayings that teach important life lessons.',
  detailedContent: '''
A proverb is a short saying that expresses wisdom or gives advice.

Unlike idioms, proverbs usually teach a moral lesson.

Examples include:

• "Actions speak louder than words."
Meaning: What people do is more important than what they say.

• "Practice makes perfect."
Meaning: Improvement comes through repeated effort.

• "A stitch in time saves nine."
Meaning: Solving a problem early prevents bigger problems later.

• "Honesty is the best policy."
Meaning: Being truthful is always the best choice.

• "Where there is a will, there is a way."
Meaning: Determination helps people succeed.

Understanding proverbs helps learners appreciate literature and communicate more effectively.

Many cultures have their own unique proverbs, but the lessons they teach are often universal.
